# R/Shiny Todo List

I needed to learn R/Shiny, so I did the generic thing of making a todo list. Wow. Imagination 100.

I mean, it's fairly dodgy:

-   It throws an error if the list is empty
-   You have to type the name to remove an item, or mark it done
-   You can't mark something as not done if you mark it done (that's a very simple fix though)
-   It's just displayed in a table
-   It doesn't present legitimate issues (like "Item Not Found" or "Duplicate Item") to the user.
